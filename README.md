# Fishing Vessels Aggregator
It is an aggregator about fisihing vessels information which I am going to submit for Fishackathon 2016 held on 22-25 April, 2016 at Ocean Park, Hong Kong.

# What is the problem to address
For Fishing Vessels, there is a lot of data available on the internet such as pictures, permits, quota, unique vessel identifiers, owner, operator and etc. The information exist but has following problems
* It is un-organized
* It doesn't exist in standardized form 
* It is available on different sources
* It does not exist at single place

It requires to address to solve above problem in simple manner.

# Solution

The solution is to pull information directly from all kinds of freely available on the internet and then aggregate them into a useful, easy-to-search, standardized
format. Once the information is collected, end user see those informations on the simple web page. The page can be open from any device which has browser.
